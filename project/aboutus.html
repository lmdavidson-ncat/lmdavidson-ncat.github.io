      <h2>Our History:</h2>
      <p>Lilly B was created in honor of our CEO's grandmother, Lillian Beatrice. Miss Beatrice was a force to be reckoned with in the education world and was an excellent coder. Unfortuantely, Miss Beatrice passed in 2022. This game was one way to keep her memory alive while honoring her with a way to teach others.</p>
